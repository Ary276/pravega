        "Charles Darwin was only 22 years old when he grabbed the golden opportunity to aboard the HMS Beagle as a naturalist. Fast forward to 2021, the numerous species unearthed by Darwin are now being taken care of by the famous naturalist himself. Unlike any other place, this is the real-world realm: an island created by Darwin, nurturing every life form from the finches to the sloths - all far away from the busy world.",
        "Now growing old, Darwin has to select his successor, someone, equally interested in these beautiful creatures, to take care of his biggest achievement- The Darwin Realm. Who better than you, the young minds! Do you have the skill set to be the next Darwin? Can you spot new findings in the surroundings? Can you live up to his expectations?",
        "Come join us in this two-staged enthralling quest, follow Darwin’s footsteps in a new voyage that tests your skills. Nothing to lose, and all you gain is the chance of being, next ship ‘naturalist’!",
        "This is not going to be that easy though! Conceptual quiz, reasoning abilities, problem-solving skills, many such challenges, and games that Darwin has set on the map. Cross all obstacles, become Darwin’s assistant, and join him in this new voyage, awaiting many more discoveries!",
	"<b>Round 1:</b> Answer a set of questions, join Darwin in his voyage, and showcase your skills and abilities in the challenges that lie ahead and impress him.",
	"<b>Round 2: </b>You have the opportunity to take care of Darwin's world! Assist Darwin in his field experiments, look after the creatures and prove that you are an able assistant and successor!",
	"<b>The registration for WWDD closes tomorrow (13 June 2021, Sunday) at 10:00 IST.</b>"
