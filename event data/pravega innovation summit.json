        "Pravega Innovation Summit (PIS) is a platform to present your innovative entrepreneurial ideas in front of professionals, market experts, and possible investors and compete with others nationwide. Not only will the teams get exposure and suggestions from our professionals, but they will also stand a chance to win prizes up to INR 75k and leave a profound impact on society!        ",
        "An excellent innovative idea will be the one that will be sustainable; that is, it will stand the test of time, along with preserving novelty and making it financially plausible so that it can change society for the better. Innovation can be anywhere; it might be in a problem that we are currently facing, or it can be something new that the world has never imagined before.",
        "If this is something you would like to get your hands on, here is a chance to prove what you are capable of!"
