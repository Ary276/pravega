                                    We are really happy to announce that this event is our newest
                                    addition to the pool of events, starting from this year. If you have ever
                                    participated in an online game-jam, the principles are exactly the same. This is
                                    a 48-hour game making marathon, focused on design, mechanics, and clever
                                    ideas.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Like in every game-jam, there will be a particular theme (which will be
                                    announced at the time of the event) and a specific span of time. You have to
                                    make a game based upon that theme. Simple, right?
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    After building the game, submit it through the appropriate portal, and
                                    they will be played, evaluated, and the winners will be decided by the judges.
                                </p>

                                    <li>The only “real” rule is that your game must not include any content that
                                        is NSFW, or offensive/discriminatory to others. We want games to be
                                        playable by everyone, after all!</li>
                                    <li>Other than that, feel free to use any game engine or framework that you
                                        like! You can also use assets that were not made by you, but make sure
                                        that you have the rights to use them. You can, of course, make everything
                                        yourself and be extra proud at the end!</li>
                                    <li>The games will be rated in the categories of Aesthetics, Gameplay,
