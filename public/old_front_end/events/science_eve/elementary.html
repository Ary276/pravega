                                    abstract: "Properties of chemical entities in confined nanospace are expected to be different from their bulk properties due to restricted rotational and vibrational motions. Such restricted motions along with other interaction(s) may allow to stabilize unusual conformations of compounds in confined space of molecular cavities. Moreover, reactivity and reaction pathways in confined space may become different from traditional bulk reactions leading to the formation of unusual product(s). In this regard, chemists have been trying to design artificial molecular vessels to perform chemical reactions in their confined nanospace. Design of 3D molecular architectures having hydrophobic confined space including their use for catalytic organic transformations will be discussed. The lecture will also focus on the interior decoration of nanocages with urea moieties for new generation discrete heterogeneous catalysts for Michael addition. It is also planned to focus on our recent work on the use of confined space of discrete organic cages for the nucleation of tiny palladium nanoparticles and their successful use in photocatalytic transformation of nitroaromatics to corresponding azo-compounds. Our recent work on the design of enantiopure coordination cages for enantioselective recognition will also be presented in brief. ",

Often general questions are asked in the early stages of one’s education, just as it happened in the beginning of human civilization before different disciplines evolved. A question asked in my UG days that took thirty years even to get a partial answer will be presented. This involved the search for an equivalent of structural and electronic structural relationships of compounds of carbon and its allotropes, in the chemistry of boron. This has led to development of interrelationships amongst polyhedral boranes, beta-rhombohedral boron, borophenes and borospherenes, in many ways related to fullerenes and graphene. ",

The underlying biochemical unity of all living organisms on Earth allows us to think deeply about the origins of life and its evolution over billions of years, resulting in the remarkable diversity of both prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms. Chemistry’s iconic image is Mendeleev’s Periodic Table, with about 20 elements necessary for the sustenance of life.  Just as Darwinian natural selection lies at the heart of biology, the Periodic Table, whose 150th anniversary was celebrated in 2019, forms the unshakeable foundation of chemistry. The biochemist Arthur Kornberg famously declared chemistry as the lingua franca of biology and medicine. Theodosius Dobzhansky’s dictum that “nothing in biology makes sense except in the light of evolution” is one that every student of biology (and indeed, all of us) must remember. We may also do well to remember that “chemistry is the engine that drives biology”. This presentation will highlight the importance of chemical evolution as a precursor to biological evolution.",

Both viruses contain viroporins, which are small, single pass transmembrane proteins that oligomerize to form ion channels. The influenza M2 viroporin is a clinically approved antiviral drug target, and deleting or blocking the envelope (E) protein from other coronaviruses slows viral growth, suggesting that the E protein could be a potential target for COVID-19 vaccine and antiviral development. Although the oligomeric state of the M2 and E proteins are thought to be tetrameric and pentameric respectively, it is challenging to determine the oligomeric states of small transmembrane peptide complexes within membranes. Here, we will present our work interfacing native or nondenaturing mass spectrometry (MS) with lipid nanodiscs to directly measure the oligomeric state of protein and peptide complexes within intact model lipid bilayers. We will start by introducing native MS in the context of measuring drug binding for SARS-CoV-2 proteins. We will then discuss recent work developing methods to study the lipid and oligomeric specificity of antimicrobial peptide complexes in nanodiscs with different lipids. Finally, we will discuss ongoing research on M2 and the E protein. In both cases, native MS data suggests a more complex picture of the oligomeric state than previously assumed, highlighting the need for novel analytical methods to understand how these important biomedical targets interact within lipid membranes.",
