        abstract: "Properties of chemical entities in confined nanospace are expected to be different from their bulk properties due to restricted rotational and vibrational motions. Such restricted motions along with other interaction(s) may allow to stabilize unusual conformations of compounds in confined space of molecular cavities. Moreover, reactivity and reaction pathways in confined space may become different from traditional bulk reactions leading to the formation of unusual product(s). In this regard, chemists have been trying to design artificial molecular vessels to perform chemical reactions in their confined nanospace. Design of 3D molecular architectures having hydrophobic confined space including their use for catalytic organic transformations will be discussed. The lecture will also focus on the interior decoration of nanocages with urea moieties for new generation discrete heterogeneous catalysts for Michael addition. It is also planned to focus on our recent work on the use of confined space of discrete organic cages for the nucleation of tiny palladium nanoparticles and their successful use in photocatalytic transformation of nitroaromatics to corresponding azo-compounds. Our recent work on the design of enantiopure coordination cages for enantioselective recognition will also be presented in brief. ",

        abstract: "No question is elementary; yet in some ways all questions are. Often general questions are asked in the early stages of oneâ€™s education, just as it happened in the beginning of human civilization before different disciplines evolved. A question asked in my UG days that took thirty years even to get a partial answer will be presented. This involved the search for an equivalent of structural and electronic structural relationships of compounds of carbon and its allotropes, in the chemistry of boron. This has led to development of interrelationships amongst polyhedral boranes, beta-rhombohedral boron, borophenes and borospherenes, in many ways related to fullerenes and graphene. ",
