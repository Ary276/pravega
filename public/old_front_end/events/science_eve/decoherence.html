These mainly involve particulate flows, and flows where the viscosity varies in space and time. She will try to outline what is exciting about these, and to show that lots of questions about the flows all around us need answering.",

Thinking in 2+1 dimensions (space+time), particle world lines, or paths through space-time, can be interpreted as knots. The quantum amplitude for certain processes is a topological invariant of that link. While sounding rather exotic, we believe that this sort of knotting physics has actually been observed in quantum Hall experiments, and could provide a route to building a quantum computer.",
